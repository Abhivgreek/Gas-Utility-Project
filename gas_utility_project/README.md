# Gas Utility Service - Backend Application

This project is a backend application for managing customer service requests in a gas utility company. It is built using **Django**, a Python-based web framework, and allows customers to submit, track, and view service requests. It also provides tools for customer support representatives to manage and respond to customer inquiries.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for developing the backend.
- **SQLite** (default) or any other DBMS: For managing the database.
- **Python 3.x**: Backend programming language.
- **pip**: Python package manager.

## Project Setup

### Pre-requisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Python 3.x** (version 3.8 or above)
- **pip** (Python package manager)

You can verify if Python and pip are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gas-utility-service.git
cd gas-utility-service
```

### Setup Virtual Environment

1. Create a new virtual environment in the project directory:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   **On Windows:**

   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **On macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Your terminal prompt should now change to show the virtual environment name, like `(venv)`.

### Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Django and any other necessary Python packages.

### Apply Migrations

Django uses migrations to handle changes to the database schema. To apply the migrations, run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command will set up the database and apply any pending migrations.

### Run the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, the server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

You should see a message similar to the following:

```bash
Django version 4.x.x, using settings 'gas_utility_service.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```

### Usage

- **API Endpoints**: 
  - **/api/requests/**: To submit, track, and view customer service requests.
  - **/admin/**: Admin dashboard for managing customer service requests (requires admin login).

- **Admin Panel**: 
  After creating a superuser, you can access the Django Admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. You can manage users, view requests, and perform other administrative tasks.

  To create a superuser for the Django admin, run:

  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

  Follow the prompts to set up the admin credentials.

### Testing

To run tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

This will discover and run all test cases in the `tests.py` file of each app.

### Deployment

To deploy this project to a production server, you can use WSGI servers like **Gunicorn** or **Waitress**. Here's how you can deploy using **Waitress**:

1. Install Waitress if you haven’t already:

   ```bash
   pip install waitress
   ```

2. Run the application with Waitress:

   ```bash
   waitress-serve --port=8000 gas_utility_service.wsgi:application
   ```

Make sure to configure the production database and settings as necessary for deployment.
